==================

Utilities and tools for working with LibraryCloud - the main application is collectionbuilder

CollectionsAPI_Tester
---------------------
This page allows for viewing and manipulation of Collection information using JQuery 1.11.0.

Deploying librarycloud_utils
---------------------
Deploy for librarycloud_utils is a simple git pull of the tagged version on the dev/qa and prod servers. There is a jira story in the backlog to change this to conform closer to the librarycloud and librarycloud_collections deploys (https://jira.huit.harvard.edu/browse/LTSCLOUD-1109). 

Configuration is handled in config.js (see config.js.example), and is in place on the dev/qa/prod servers.

When a release is ready it should follow major.minor.micro pattern  
Such as 1.1.0 (next as of 2022-02-09)
